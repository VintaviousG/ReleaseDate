# Release Date for TV Shows, games, and movies.


## Story

When the PS5 and Xbox Series X were released, it was very hectic to purchase either console. Store websites would break because of how many people were trying to buy a console all at once. Anytime anyone goes on Gamestop, Walmart, or Best Buy, it would say, “Out of Stock.” That is what struck my interest in building this website. 

## What It Does
The site is for people who would like information on a movie, tv-show and seasons, or games to be released. I have each page separated between popular and most anticipated. Once I learn more about Javascript, I would like to make it a complete website.

## Technologies
HTML/CSS
Bootstrap 4
